# CareerTrack
This is my skilltest project for Coding Ninjas.
CareerTrack is the application for the employees of the coding ninjas to make a record of the students in the institute.
This is used to track the details of the students from basic details to their scores and wheather they are placed or not.
Also they can allocate interviews for the students from here.
To install this project on local system just clone and run "npm install" command in terminal.
Add your database location in "./config/mongoose" in variable db as "localhost" if you want to use locally or
you can also add your cloud databse link here.
You need to have mongo db installed on your local system to use locally.
This project is live on https://careertrack.onrender.com/ you can try it.
Thank you.
